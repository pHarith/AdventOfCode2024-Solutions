The solution to day 7 problem was rather simple, with one rather tricky part - recursion and using dfs

Let us break down the solution step-by-step here:

1. We read files in the form of
target: a b c ... where a, b and c are operands

Using a combination of + and *, left to right, these operands should evaluate to target.

For example: 190: 15 4 10 => 190 = 15 + 4 * 10 = 19 * 10 = 190

2. Read the files line by line, using split(':') to split operands and target, then strip().split() to separate each operands
into a list.

3. Recursive solution - here comes the hard part, and we will break down how we do it for a smaller case
190 = 15 4 10

########### CODE GOES HERE #################

def validate_operation(target, operands, ops):
    def dfs_solve(index, current):
        
        if index == len(operands): 
            return current == target
        
        for op in ops:
            # Apply the operator between current running result and the next operand
            next_val = apply_opr(op, current, operands[index])

            if dfs_solve(index + 1, next_val):
                return True

    return dfs_solve(1, current=operands[0])

########### CODE ENDS ######################

(i). validate_operation(190, [15, 4, 10], ['+', '*']) is called.
(ii). first recursion => dfs_solve(1, 15) where 15 is the first operand, 1 is the next index (4)
(iii). into dfs_solve, we iterate through ops and compute each possible value
15 + 4 = 19 - loop 1, 15 * 4 = 60 - loop 2
(iv). if dfs_solve(index + 1, next_val): => second recursion, we use result of 19 (first loop)
and pass it through dfs_solve => dfs_solve(2, 19) where 2 is index of the last operand (10)
(v). same step as (iii) => 19 + 10 = 29, 19 * 10 = 190
(vi). dfs_solve(3, 29) will return 29 == 190, which is False, so we move to 2nd loop dfs_solve(3, 190)
which returns true
(vii). We move up through recursion to our original dfs_solve(2, 19), and return True. The function terminates here.

4. We keep doing this for each line, any line of operation returns True (target = sums/prods of operands), we add it to final
result and return this result.

5. For part 2, all we do is add a concaternate operand (||), which is as simple as a || b = int(str(a) + str(b)).
